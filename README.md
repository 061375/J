# J$.js

I wanted to build a lightweight jQuery sort of a library using Typescript that only has what I needed.
I am an "aging" programmer who cut his teeth primarily using jQuery and I have a lot of code that is actually pretty basic that would probably benefit from a scaled down version.
I didn't copy anything anything from jQuery. I just built it as I thought made sense.
Anyways, as usual, it seemed like a fun project to fill some time when it's raining
